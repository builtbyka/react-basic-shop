                    <p>This is not an easy question and it doesn't matter what your answers were. But to answer the question, itâ€™s likely that you created a simple business formula and used some basics maths skills. You probably thought about your initial start-up costs, the costs involved in making a product or offering a service, and the income you would hope to achieve.
